In order to start creating your assist from the template you will need to download it [Here.](https://cdn.mcleodgaming.com/fraytools/downloads/17745ac3/fraymakers-assist-template-0.1.0.zip)

### Creating Your Project From Template
Open FrayTools and click on **File** on the top left and select **New Project From Template**, if you have done the previous steps correctly
you should see the assist template you had just installed, select it. This will create a new project using the files of the template.

Click on **File** on the top left and select **Publish Project** and then **Publish All** this will creata a .fra file in the build folder of your project.
Next on Steam right click on Fraymakers and go to properties, from there click **Browse** this will take you to the Fraymakers install directory, from here
open or create a folder called **custom** this is the folder where you will put your .fra file.
